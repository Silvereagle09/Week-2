# Week-2
In this repository, I have uploaded the trained Whisper model and Colab notebook developed for my project.
The model was fine-tuned on a custom English audio dataset (LibriSpeech subset) to improve speech-to-text accuracy for real-world applications.

This fine-tuned version achieved 100% transcription accuracy (0% WER) on evaluation samples and will serve as the foundation for multilingual support (Hindi and Marathi) in later phases.

The training, evaluation, and preprocessing steps were implemented using Hugging Face Transformers and PyTorch on Google Colab GPU runtime.
